# Staff Management Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the staff management functionality for the BadgerStaffPanel+.

## Overview

The staff management system allows administrators to:
- View all staff members with their statistics
- Add new staff members
- Edit existing staff member details
- Delete staff members
- Filter and search staff members
- View staff statistics (admins, moderators, helpers, active staff)

## Database Changes

### New Migration
A new migration file `2024_12_19_000000_add_fields_to_staff_table.php` has been created to add the following fields to the `staff` table:

- `role` (enum: admin, moderator, helper) - Staff role
- `status` (enum: active, inactive, suspended) - Staff status
- `join_date` (date) - When the staff member joined
- `notes` (text) - Additional notes about the staff member
- `last_active` (timestamp) - Last activity timestamp

### Running the Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## API Endpoints

### GET Endpoints
- `GET /api/staff` - Get all staff members with statistics
- `GET /api/staff/statistics` - Get staff statistics
- `GET /api/staff/{staff_id}` - Get specific staff member
- `GET /api/staff/getStaffIdFromDiscord/{discord_id}` - Get staff by Discord ID
- `GET /api/staff/getKickedPlayerCount/{staff_id}` - Get kick count for staff
- `GET /api/staff/getBannedPlayerCount/{staff_id}` - Get ban count for staff

### POST Endpoints
- `POST /api/staff/create` - Create new staff member

### PUT Endpoints
- `PUT /api/staff/{staff_id}` - Update staff member

### DELETE Endpoints
- `DELETE /api/staff/{staff_id}` - Delete staff member

### PATCH Endpoints
- `PATCH /api/staff/{staff_id}/last-active` - Update last active time

## Model Updates

### Staff Model (`app/Models/Staff.php`)
Added new methods:
- `getTotalActionsCount()` - Get total actions for staff member
- `getStaffStatistics()` - Get overall staff statistics
- `getAllStaffWithStats()` - Get all staff with action counts

## Controller Updates

### StaffController (`app/Http/Controllers/StaffController.php`)
Complete CRUD operations implemented:
- `createNewStaff()` - Create new staff with validation
- `updateStaff()` - Update existing staff
- `deleteStaff()` - Delete staff member
- `getStaffStatistics()` - Get statistics
- `updateLastActive()` - Update last active timestamp

## Frontend Implementation

### View (`resources/views/verified/management/manage_staff.blade.php`)
- Real-time data loading from backend
- AJAX-based CRUD operations
- Search and filter functionality
- Responsive design with Bootstrap
- Modal forms for add/edit operations

### JavaScript Features
- Form validation
- AJAX requests to API endpoints
- Real-time table updates
- Search and filter functionality
- Toast notifications (fallback to alerts)

## Seeding Data

A `StaffSeeder` has been created with sample data:
- 1 Admin user
- 2 Moderators (1 active, 1 inactive)
- 1 Helper user

To seed the database:
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=StaffSeeder
```

Or run all seeders:
```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

## Usage

1. **Access the page**: Navigate to `/verified/management/manage_staff`
2. **View staff**: All staff members are displayed with their statistics
3. **Add staff**: Click "Add Staff Member" button and fill the form
4. **Edit staff**: Click the edit button on any staff row
5. **Delete staff**: Click the delete button and confirm
6. **Search**: Use the search box to filter by name, Discord, or role
7. **Filter**: Use the role dropdown to filter by specific roles

## Security Features

- CSRF protection on all forms
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Password hashing for new staff members
- Authentication middleware on all routes
- Unique constraints on username and email

## Error Handling

- Form validation errors are displayed to users
- API errors are caught and displayed as toast notifications
- Database errors are logged and user-friendly messages shown

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Role-based permissions for staff management
- Bulk operations (bulk delete, bulk role change)
- Staff activity logs
- Email notifications for staff changes
- Advanced filtering options
- Export functionality
- Staff performance metrics

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
2. Seed data: `php artisan db:seed`
3. Access the staff management page
4. Test all CRUD operations
5. Test search and filter functionality
